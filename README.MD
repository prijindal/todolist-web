# TODO List

This is a todo list, implemented in Flask

Right now it requires a lot of stuff to be pre installed on your system to work
which includes

**Mongo DB**

**pip and Python**

**npm**

I would suggest you to use **virtualenv** to install this, all you have to do is clone the repository and run the following

```
$ git clone https://github.com/prijindal/todolist.git
$ cd todolist/
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ npm install
```

and to run it
```
    (venv)$ python app.py
```

Thank You!!
